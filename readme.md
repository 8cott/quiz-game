Quiz Game! by Scott Rubin
GitHub Username: 8cott

Inspiration:
I always liked to play quiz/trivia games to test my knowledge and I thought it would be the perfect format to use the skills I learned so far in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My goal was to start simple and then make it more complex as time allowed. I have so many more ideas that I won't have time for, but will try to add them in the future. 

Notes:
I used lots of tags in the code to explain what I was doing.
The layout is responsive for mobile devices. Tested on an iPhone 14 Pro Max.
I designed the website with a simple black, purple, and grey design. 

Open Trivia API:
This quiz uses randomly generated questions from the Open Trivia database at https://opentdb.com/. Credit is given in the footer.cx

Instructions:
Game starts on page load. 
The question is displayed in the center.
Below is the category (which is random) and difficulty level (set to easy).
Click on one of the 4 possible answers and the box will change to green for correct and red for incorrect. 
When an incorrect answer is chosen, the correct answer will be displayed in the box below the choices. 
At the very bottom, the question number and score is displayed. 
Each question is worth 10 points, with a maximum score of 100. 
Once 10 questions have been answered, the game is over and final score is displayed. 
You will be given the option to start a new game.
