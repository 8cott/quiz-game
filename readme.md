# Quiz Game!
This game was my first milestone project for my Software Development Bootcamp at NYU. The instructions were to create a game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I always enjoyed playing quiz/trivia games to test my knowledge, and I thought it would be the perfect format to apply the skills I learned so far. My goal was to start simple and gradually make it more complex. Although I have many more ideas that I won't have time to implement, I may add them in the future. The code includes detailed comments to explain what I was doing. The layout is responsive and has been tested on an iPhone 14 Pro Max. The website features a simple design with black, purple, and grey color scheme.
